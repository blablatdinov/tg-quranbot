        This bot is an automated tool designed to help maintain repositories by
        identifying and notifying about stagnant code files that might require
        review. It assists in keeping your projects up-to-date and promotes
        regular code reviews to ensure code quality.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        CodeReviewBot analyzes the commit history of files within your repository to identify files that have not been
        modified for a certain period of time. When it detects such stagnant files, it creates an issue within the
        repository, suggesting that a code review may be needed for those files.
      </p>
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Automated identification of stagnant code files.
        Creation of issues for files that haven't been modified recently.
        Customizable time threshold for considering files as stagnant.
        Helps maintain code quality by encouraging regular reviews.
        Reduces the risk of having outdated or unmaintained code.
      </p>
      <h2>Configure:</h2>
      <p>You can install the bot either via GitHub Marketplace or manually.</p>
      <h3>Option 1: Install via GitHub Marketplace (Recommended)</h3>
      <p>1. Visit the bot's GitHub <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/revive-code-bot">Marketplace page</a></p>
      <p>2. Click Install and follow the prompts to grant access to the bot.</p>
      <p>3. After installation, the bot will automatically start working with your repository.</p>
      <h3>Option 2: Manual Installation</h3>
      <p>If you cannot use GitHub Marketplace, follow these two steps to configure the bot manually:</p>
      <h3>Step 1: Grant Access to the Bot</h3>
      <p>1. Open your GitHub repository.</p>
      <p>2. Go to Settings > Collaborators and teams.</p>
      <p>3. In the Collaborators section, click Invite a collaborator.</p>
      <p>4. Enter the bot's GitHub username (e.g., <code>@revive-bot</code>) and send the invitation.</p>
      <h3>Step 2: Add a Webhook</h3>
      <p>1. Open your repository and go to Settings > Webhooks.</p>
      <p>2. Click "Add webhook".</p>
      <p>
        3. Use the following URL as the Payload URL:
        <code>https://www.rehttp.net/p/https://revive-code-bot.ilaletdinov.ru/hook/github</code>
      </p>
      <p>4. Set the Content type to `application/json`.</p>
      <p>5. Select "Issue comments", "Issues", "Pushes" event as the trigger event.</p>
      <p>6. Click "Add webhook" to save.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>To configure the app, create a <code>.revive-bot.yml</code> file in the root of your repository with the
        following options:</p>
      <pre>
# Schedule when the bot checks for stagnant files (cron format)
# Visit https://crontab.guru
cron: '11 2 6 * *'  # Runs on the 6th day of each month at 02:11 AM

# Define file patterns to analyze using glob syntax
# glob: '**/*.py'  # Analyze all Python files
# glob: 'src/**/*.js'  # Analyze JavaScript files in the src directory and its subdirectories
glob: '**/*.py'  # Example: analyze all Python files

# Limit the maximum number of files listed in an issue
limit: 5
      </pre>
